# GameOfLife

Game of Life is one of the most famous games in the IT industry. I did my own version, with a few controls and UI labels.

Keep in mind, this version would not run because I used the Arial font and it can not be included into this repository because it's license is not free.
To be able to play the game just move your copy of the arial font into GameOfLife/assets/fonts/arial.ttf

If you would like to use another font, just change the font name in the code to your font.

# Getting started

To compile the program in windows, just run the CreateSolutions.bat file. It is automatically going to build the Visual Studio 2019 project files.
After generating the solution files you can open the GameOfLife Solution and build and execute the Release build. Note that only x64 builds are supported.
