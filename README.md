# GameOfLife

Game of Life is one of the most famous games in the IT industry. I did my own version, with a few controls and UI labels.

# Getting started

To compile the program in windows, just run the CreateSolutions.bat file. It is automatically going to build the Visual Studio 2019 project files.
After generating the solution files you can open the GameOfLife Solution and build and execute the Release build. Note that only x64 builds are supported.
