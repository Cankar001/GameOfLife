# GameOfLife

Game of Life is one of the most famous games in the IT industry. I did my own version, with a few controls and UI labels.

Keep in mind, this version would not run because I used the Arial font and it can not be included into this repository because it's license is not free.
To be able to play the game just move your copy of the arial font into GameOfLife/assets/fonts/arial.ttf

If you would like to use another font, just change the font name in the code to your font.
